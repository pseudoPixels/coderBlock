Recently I’ve visited a strange village where lived two kinds of peoples. One is saint, who always tells the truth and another is liar who always tells lie. While roaming around I’ve talked with two persons named “A” and “B”. But I couldn’t find out what kind of person they are (saint or liar?). But I’ve written down all of their conversations in a notebook. Your task is to write a program that will read that conversation and will display what type of person “A” and “B” are.
