Recently me and my friends were coming to IUT by taxi cab and found that there are several LEDs not working. So when a number is displayed in the meter, it was very difficult to understand what the actual digit was. Your task is to write a program that will help us to know the currently displaying digit. You will be told what are broken LEDs and also the LEDs that are currently lit.
